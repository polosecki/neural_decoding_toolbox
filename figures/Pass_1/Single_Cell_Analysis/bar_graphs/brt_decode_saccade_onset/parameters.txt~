Monkey: Quincy
Area(s): PITd, LIP

Binning:
  Bin Width: 30 steps (100 mS)
  Step Size: 30 steps (100 mS)

Time:
  Aligned on stimulus onset
  Start -500 mS, window length 2000 mS
  
Classes:
  Training:
	1: BRT = 0, phi = 90 & BRT = 0, phi = 270
	2: BRT = 180, phi = 90 & BRT = 180, phi = 270

  Testing:
	1: BRT = 0, phi = 0 & BRT = 0, phi = 180
	2: BRT = 180, phi = 0 & BRT = 180, phi = 180		 

Looking for:
  Decoding ability of PITd and LIP w.r.t. BRT position
