to_save
save_data_batch: make sure the list of bad files is up_to_date, or even better that it referers to the bad_files script 
save_neural_data:creates the raster data in decoding toolbox format for a given cell

to_clean:
save_clean_data_batch: a loop, that calls save_clean_neural_window for each cell
save_clean_neural_window: given neural data, clears all trials containing nans withing desired window

to_populate:
prepare_for_populating: loop, calls prepare_cell_labels_for_pop for each cell
prepare_cell_labels_for_pop: make abolsute labels a copy of relative labels
permute_cell_labels_func: permute the relative cell labels
create_population_folder_func: copies individual cells to population


to decode:
params.decode.to_reshuffle: determines if null distribution is calculated?
How many "features" are used? Number of features to use is set to 25. How to see!
run_single_decoding_batch might be the place to edit this. See what files call: determine num_valid_sited


to special decode:
the same a to decode
seems not to work for null distribution yet? (if null decode is set to 1, is_pecial is set to 0)

to null_decode

to plot confusion:
analyze_confusion_population: calls analyze_resample_confusion or get_confusion_matrix_population and makes the plot

to plot mean:
mean_decoding: calls get_decoding_results and makes the plot

to compare:
use_fewer_NULL: option so that the pvalue object computes a null distribution por all time point (currently unused).
make_comparative_decode_plots
make_comparative_conf_plots

to_compute_sig:
compute_significance_across_area: for comparison between areas
